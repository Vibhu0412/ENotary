      AGE VERIFICATION POLICY:
      </h4>
        <p>
        You must be at least 21 years of age to order or receive alcoholic beverages. Any shipments containing alcoholic beverages are sent with an “Adult Signature Required” sticker. All carriers who deliver alcoholic beverages are required to ask and check for identification upon delivery. This means that you or someone over the age of 21 will need to be present at the time of delivery to sign for your shipment. We highly recommend having your wine shipped to a business to avoid any potential delays.”
